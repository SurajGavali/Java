## Sample Answers and Code for Each Question

### ðŸ“– Basics & Definitions

1. **What is the Java Stream API?**
   - The Java Stream API is a feature introduced in Java 8 that allows functional-style operations on collections of elements, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing.
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
     numbers.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
     ```

2. **How does the Stream API differ from a Collection?**
   - Collections store and manage data; Streams process data. Streams do not store elements and are not reusable.
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b");
     Stream<String> stream = list.stream();
     ```

3. **Can you explain what a stream pipeline is?**
   - A stream pipeline is a sequence of stream operations (source, intermediate, terminal) chained together.
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob");
     names.stream().filter(n -> n.startsWith("A")).forEach(System.out::println);
     ```

4. **What is the difference between intermediate and terminal operations in streams?**
   - Intermediate operations return a new stream and are lazy (e.g., filter, map). Terminal operations produce a result and end the stream (e.g., collect, forEach).
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     // filter is intermediate, collect is terminal
     List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
     ```

5. **What is the difference between a sequential stream and a parallel stream?**
   - Sequential streams process elements one after another; parallel streams process elements concurrently using multiple threads.
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     list.stream().forEach(System.out::println); // sequential
     list.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println); // parallel
     ```

### ðŸ“– Stream Creation

6. **How do you create a stream from a collection?**
   - Use the `.stream()` method on a collection.
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b");
     Stream<String> stream = list.stream();
     ```

7. **How do you create a stream from an array?**
   - Use `Arrays.stream(array)` or `Stream.of(array)`.
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     String[] arr = {"a", "b"};
     Stream<String> stream = Arrays.stream(arr);
     ```

8. **How can you create an empty stream?**
   - Use `Stream.empty()`.
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     Stream<String> empty = Stream.empty();
     ```

9. **How can you create a stream using the Stream.of() method?**
   - Use `Stream.of(elements...)`.
   - *Sample code:*
     ```java
     Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3);
     ```

10. **How can you create a stream of primitive types (IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream)?**
    - Use `IntStream`, `LongStream`, or `DoubleStream`.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      IntStream intStream = IntStream.range(1, 5); // 1,2,3,4
      ```

### ðŸ“– Intermediate Operations

11. **What does the filter() operation do in a stream?**
    - It filters elements based on a condition (predicate).
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

12. **How does the map() operation work in a stream?**
    - It transforms each element using a function.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<String> upper = names.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

13. **Whatâ€™s the difference between map() and flatMap()?**
    - `map()` transforms each element; `flatMap()` flattens nested streams.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      // map
      List<String> upper = names.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).collect(Collectors.toList());
      // flatMap
      List<String> words = sentences.stream().flatMap(s -> Arrays.stream(s.split(" "))).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

14. **How does distinct() work on a stream?**
    - It removes duplicate elements.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<Integer> unique = Arrays.asList(1,2,2,3).stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

15. **How does sorted() work on a stream? How can you sort custom objects?**
    - It sorts elements. For custom objects, provide a comparator.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<String> sorted = names.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());
      // Custom sort
      list.stream().sorted(Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge)).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

16. **How does the limit() operation work?**
    - It limits the stream to a given number of elements.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<Integer> firstTwo = numbers.stream().limit(2).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

17. **What does the skip() operation do?**
    - It skips the first N elements.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<Integer> skipped = numbers.stream().skip(2).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

18. **How can you remove duplicates from a stream?**
    - Use `distinct()`.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<Integer> unique = numbers.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

### ðŸ“– Terminal Operations

19. **What does the collect() operation do?**
    - It gathers the elements of a stream into a collection or other result.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<String> list = names.stream().collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

20. **How can you convert a stream to a list or set using collect()?**
    - Use `Collectors.toList()` or `Collectors.toSet()`.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<String> list = stream.collect(Collectors.toList());
      Set<String> set = stream.collect(Collectors.toSet());
      ```

21. **How does the forEach() terminal operation work?**
    - It performs an action for each element in the stream.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      names.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
      ```

22. **Whatâ€™s the difference between forEach() and forEachOrdered()?**
    - `forEach()` may not preserve order in parallel streams; `forEachOrdered()` always does.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      stream.parallel().forEachOrdered(System.out::println);
      ```

23. **How can you use count() on a stream?**
    - It returns the number of elements in the stream.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      long count = names.stream().count();
      ```

24. **How can you get the minimum or maximum value from a stream?**
    - Use `min()` or `max()` with a comparator.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      Optional<String> min = names.stream().min(String::compareTo);
      Optional<String> max = names.stream().max(String::compareTo);
      ```

25. **How does the reduce() method work? Can you give a simple example?**
    - It combines elements using an operation (e.g., sum, concatenate).
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
      ```

26. **How does anyMatch(), allMatch(), and noneMatch() work?**
    - They check if any, all, or none of the elements match a condition.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      boolean any = names.stream().anyMatch(n -> n.startsWith("A"));
      boolean all = names.stream().allMatch(n -> n.length() > 2);
      boolean none = names.stream().noneMatch(n -> n.startsWith("Z"));
      ```

27. **How does findFirst() and findAny() work?**
    - They return the first or any element from the stream as an Optional.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      Optional<String> first = names.stream().findFirst();
      Optional<String> any = names.stream().findAny();
      ```

### ðŸ“– Collectors

28. **How do you use Collectors.toList()?**
    - It collects stream elements into a List.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<String> list = stream.collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

29. **How do you use Collectors.toSet()?**
    - It collects stream elements into a Set.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      Set<String> set = stream.collect(Collectors.toSet());
      ```

30. **How do you use Collectors.toMap()?**
    - It collects elements into a Map using key and value mapping functions.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      Map<String, Integer> map = names.stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(n -> n, String::length));
      ```

31. **How can you use Collectors.joining() to concatenate strings?**
    - It joins stream elements into a single string with a delimiter.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      String joined = names.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
      ```

32. **What is the purpose of Collectors.groupingBy()? Give a simple example.**
    - It groups elements by a classifier function.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      Map<Integer, List<String>> grouped = names.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length));
      ```

### ðŸ“– Advanced (but still easy-level) Topics

33. **What is a short-circuiting operation? Give examples.**
    - An operation that may not process all elements (e.g., `findFirst()`, `anyMatch()`, `limit()`).
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      names.stream().anyMatch(n -> n.startsWith("A"));
      numbers.stream().limit(2).forEach(System.out::println);
      ```

34. **How can you parallelize a stream? Whatâ€™s the benefit?**
    - Use `.parallelStream()` or `.parallel()`. It can speed up processing for large data sets.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      list.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
      ```

35. **Is a stream reusable? Why or why not?**
    - No, streams cannot be reused. Once a terminal operation is called, the stream is closed.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      Stream<String> s = names.stream();
      s.forEach(System.out::println);
      // s.forEach(System.out::println); // Error: stream has already been operated upon or closed
      ```

36. **How can you handle exceptions inside stream operations?**
    - Use try-catch inside lambda expressions.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      names.stream().forEach(n -> {
          try {
              // risky code
          } catch (Exception e) {
              // handle
          }
      });
      ```

37. **How can you debug a stream pipeline?**
    - Use the `peek()` method to inspect elements as they flow through the pipeline.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      names.stream().peek(System.out::println).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

38. **Whatâ€™s the difference between a stream and an iterator?**
    - Streams support functional-style operations, can be parallelized, and are lazy; iterators are imperative and not parallelizable.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      Iterator<String> it = names.iterator();
      while(it.hasNext()) System.out.println(it.next());
      names.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
      ```

39. **How does lazy evaluation work in streams?**
    - Intermediate operations are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      List<Integer> result = numbers.stream().filter(n -> {
          System.out.println("Filtering: " + n);
          return n > 2;
      }).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```

40. **How does a stream close? Can you close a stream explicitly?**
    - Streams close automatically after a terminal operation. You can close a stream explicitly if it implements `AutoCloseable` (e.g., IO streams).
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      try (Stream<String> s = Files.lines(Paths.get("file.txt"))) {
          s.forEach(System.out::println);
      }
      ```

41. **Can you call a terminal operation twice on the same stream?**
    - No, a stream can only have one terminal operation. After that, it is closed.
    - *Sample code:*
      ```java
      Stream<String> s = names.stream();
      s.forEach(System.out::println);
      // s.collect(Collectors.toList()); // Error
      ```
